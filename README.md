## Description
This solution is used for Hybrid Integrations with Segment and enables Segment to send Track Events to Singular using the Singular Server-to-Server REST API. It allows for the capture of custom data points within the advertiser App where in some instances these data points are not supported by the Segment Mobile Libraries. 

> **Warning**
> This solution is NOT to be used with any formal Singular Destinations published on Segment. The solution should be strictly used for custom use-cases which can not be obtained by the current Singular integration. This solution utilizes Segment's Destination Function feature which is available to all Segment customer plan types with a free allotment of usage hours. Read more about [Functions usage limits](https://segment.com/docs/connections/functions/usage/), or see [your workspaceâ€™s Functions usage stats](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/settings/usage?metric=functions).
 
> **Note**
> Being a custom solution, this code snippet is provided as a working example and allows the developer full control to update or modify the content and behavior as desired. Singular is not responsible for maintenance of this code. The developer implementing this solution must consult the Segment and Singular documentation to troubleshoot issues if they arise. It is also the developers responsibiity to verify that only approved data is passed to Segment and then to Singular using this solution.

> **Note**
> Due to the Hybrid nature of this integration it is recommended to disable the Segment *Application Lifecycle Events*. These are disabled in the Initialization of the Segment SDK. The Singular SDK will automatically track Sessions and these *Application Lifecycle Events* are not needed. 

### Requirements
- The Singular SDK must be natively implemented in the Advertiser App. See Singular SDK documentation: [READ MORE](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/categories/360002441132)
- This solution is not to be used if you are using the Segment Device Mode Integration (SDK Wrapper).
- The Segment Mobile SDK must be Intialized before the Singular SDK.
- All Segment Track events must contain the additional properties which consist of the additional identifiers as illustrated below.

### Implementation Steps
#### Step 1 - Add support in your Mobile Apps and Web App

<details><summary>CLICK for iOS</summary>
iOS - Implement the Segment Analytics for iOS Library per Segment's documentation: [READ MORE](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/ios/#analytics-for-ios)

CODE: Obj-C
```Obj-C
// Add the following code to your didFinishLaunchingWithOptions entry point:
SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *configuration = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:SEGMENTKEY];
    configuration.trackApplicationLifecycleEvents = NO; // Enable this to record certain application events automatically!
    configuration.recordScreenViews = YES; // Enable this to record screen views automatically!
    [SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:configuration];
```
    
Add the IDFA, IDFV, and ATT status as Segment Track event properties for all of the Segment Track Events. 
- See how to retrieve the IDFA and IDFV Identifiers: [READ MORE](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360037640812--UPDATED-Server-to-Server-S2S-Integration-Guide#Retrieving_the_IDFALimit_Ad_Tracking_iOS_Identifiers)


CODE: Obj-C
```Obj-C
// Set Segment Properties Example
// DO NOT CHANGE the naming convention used in the example, as it matches the keys in the Custom Function Script.   
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] track:@"EventName"
                                properties:@{ @"singularIDFA": self.s_idfa,
                                              @"singularIDFV": self.s_idfv,
                                              @"singularATT": self.att_state
                                              }];
```
</details>

<details><summary>CLICK for Android</summary>
Android - Implement the Segment Analytics for Android Library per Segment's documentation: [READ MORE](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/android/#analytics-for-android)
    
CODE: Java
```Java
// We recommend initializing the client in your Application subclass.
// Read More here: https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/android/#step-2-initialize-the-client
Analytics analytics = new Analytics.Builder(getApplicationContext(), Constants.SEGMENTKEY)
                .recordScreenViews() // Enable this to record screen views automatically!
                .build();
```
    
Add the required code to your App to obtain needed data points or Device Identifiers. You must store the Device Identifiers inorder to access them on future Segment Track Events. Retreive the Android AppSetID, and Google Advertising ID in the App prior to Segment or Singular SDK Initialization. 
- See how to retrieve the Google Advertising Id: [READ MORE](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/ad-id)
- See how to retrieve the AppSetId: [READ MORE](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/app-set-id)
- See how to retrieve the Amazon Advertising Identifier (AMID): [READ MORE](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/policy-center/advertising-id.html)

Once you have the data points required, simply include the values in the properties of any Segment Track Event. See the example below on how the GAID and ASID are included.

CODE: Java
```Java
// GAID = the Google Advertising ID
// ASID = the Android AppSet ID
// The destination function will also support the AMID (Amazon ID) and the OAID (Specific for China).
//
Analytics.with(context).track("Bookmarked Article", new Properties()
  .putValue("title", "Snow Fall")
  .putValue("subtitle", "The Avalance at Tunnel Creek")
  .putValue("author", "John Branch")
  .putValue("singularGAID",GAID)
  .putValue("singularASID",ASID));
```

Web - Implement the Segment Analytics.js Library per the Segment documentation: [READ MORE](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#analytics-js-2-0-source)

Follow the Segment guide to add the Analytics.js library to your website. [READ MORE](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/quickstart/)
    
CODE: Javascript
```Javascript
// Your Script will look something like this:
<script>
  !function(){var analytics=window.analytics=window.analytics||[];if(!analytics.initialize)if(analytics.invoked)window.console&&console.error&&console.error("Segment snippet included twice.");else{analytics.invoked=!0;analytics.methods=["trackSubmit","trackClick","trackLink","trackForm","pageview","identify","reset","group","track","ready","alias","debug","page","once","off","on","addSourceMiddleware","addIntegrationMiddleware","setAnonymousId","addDestinationMiddleware"];analytics.factory=function(e){return function(){var t=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);t.unshift(e);analytics.push(t);return analytics}};for(var e=0;e<analytics.methods.length;e++){var key=analytics.methods[e];analytics[key]=analytics.factory(key)}analytics.load=function(key,e){var t=document.createElement("script");t.type="text/javascript";t.async=!0;t.src="https://cdn.segment.com/analytics.js/v1/" + key + "/analytics.min.js";var n=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];n.parentNode.insertBefore(t,n);analytics._loadOptions=e};analytics._writeKey="YOUR WRITE KEY";;analytics.SNIPPET_VERSION="4.15.3";
  analytics.load("YOUR WRITE KEY");
  analytics.page();
  }}();
</script>
```
    
For all Web based Segment Track Events, append the following additional properties.
- singularSDID (See how to retrieve the Web SDID: [READ MORE](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360039991491-Singular-Website-SDK-Native-Integration#Method_B_Advanced_Set_Singular_Device_ID_Manually)
- singularWebBundleId (This is a fixed value used in your Singular WebSDK Initialization, denoted as the "Product ID". [READ MORE](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360039991491-Singular-Website-SDK-Native-Integration#1_Constructing_the_SingularConfig_Object)


CODE: HTML
```HTML
<script>
  analytics.ready(function() {
    var user = analytics.user();
    var id = user.id();
    var SDID = singularSdk.getSingularDeviceId();
    var bundleId = "com.mysite.www";
    analytics.track("Order Completed", {product: "Sample", revenue: "14.99", currency: "USD", singularSDID: SDID, singularWebBundleId: bundleId});
  });
</script>
```
</details>

#### Step 2 - Setup a Custom Destination Function in Segment

Open Segment's UI:
1. Click our your Workspace
- Click "Catalog" in the left navigation
- Click "Functions" in the top menu
- Click "New Function"
- Click "Destination" and then "Build"

2. Copy the provided [Javascript Function](https://github.com/jared-singular/segment-destination-function/blob/main/destination_function.js) into the Function Code box
- Click "Settings" in the top menu, and then "Add Setting"
- Label the Setting as "Singular SDK Key"
- Leave the Type set to "String"
- toggle on the "Required" and "Sensitive" options.
- Click Add Setting

You will be prompted to enter your Singular SDK Key from: [READ MORE](https://app.singular.net/?#/sdk)

3. From the Functions screen Click the Function, and choose "+ Connect Destination"
- Select the Sources for which this Destination should be enabled.

### Testing
Using the Destination Function UI in Segment and the Singular SDK Console in the Singular UI, you may test the Javascript Function.
1. Use one of the following Sample Segment Payload for Testing. 
2. Update your "writeKey" in the Sample Payload
3. Copy the appropriate device identifier for use in the Singular SDK Console and activate listening
4. Click the "Run" button in the Segment UI.
5. Wait for the Event to display in the Singular SDK Console.
